# DevPortfolio Template

A modern, minimalist portfolio template built with Astro and Tailwind CSS. Perfect for developers looking to showcase their skills, experience, and projects in a clean, professional way.

This was completely rebuilt from the ground up from V1. This template was built to be entirely ready to go with a quick config edit (see below) but also provides the ability to easily extend in whatever way you want.

This template also comes with `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursor/rules` files for easy integration with your existing AI workflows.

## Built With

- **[Astro](https://astro.build/)** - Static site generator for modern web apps
- **[Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **[Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons)** - Free and open source icons
- **TypeScript** - For type-safe configuration

### Icons

The template uses [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons) for all icons. If you wish to add more icons and have it look consistent with what's already there, you can browse through their extensive icon library.

## Local Development

If you'd like to run it locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio.git
cd devportfolio
npm install
```

After that, start up the Astro dev server with:

```
npm run dev
```
